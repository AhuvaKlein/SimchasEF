# SimchasEF

SimchasEF is an application that organizes a Simcha Fund using Entity Framework Core. (It was originally done without EF - https://github.com/AhuvaKlein/Simchas) Each contributor can add a deposit, choose which simchas they'd like to contribute to, and has a history that displays a record of the contributor's deposits and contributions.

To get the project up and running:
Navigate to the `SimchasEF.Data` folder in your command line. Once in the correct folder, type in the command line `dotnet ef database update` This will create a database in SQL Server and then the project will be able to run.

Thank you!
